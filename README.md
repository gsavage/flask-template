# Flask Template

This template project provides a very simple Flask application with pytest configured.

It uses a venv virtual environment. This should be transparent using the Makefile.

You need python3 and make installed.

## Getting Started

1. Configure the venv and install requirements

  ```bash
  make init
  ```

2. Run tests

  ```bash
  make test
  ```

3. Run the dev server

  ```bash
  make deb
  ```
